This is a songs app that let the user to selected some songs with preselected singers and albums with considering the count and price of the selected songs.

This is done as a technical taks for applying as juinor react.js developer at adzily.com.

I built it using react, redux for state handling , saga as a middleware, and json-server for dummy databaase.

I was more focused about the react and redux part and built nice -not fancy- UI.

You can find a video demo for the app working here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rc-pnEYN8GAqo5y0JkvqTDCmarOJ-iO3/view?usp=sharing
